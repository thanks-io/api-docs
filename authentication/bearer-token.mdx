# API Key

All API requests must be authenticated with a bearer token. This token can be created in your [API Settings](https://dashboard.thanks.io/profile/api) under the "Personal Access Tokens (API Key)" section.

# Bearer Token

Once you have created a token, you can use it to authenticate your API requests by including it in the `Authorization` header as follows:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

# Example Request

Here is an example of how to make an authenticated request using `curl`:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST "https://api.thanks.io/api/v2/send/postcard" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
      "recipients": [{ 
        "name": "John Doe", 
        "address": "123 Main Street, Any Town, NY 12345"
      }],
      "message": "Hi %FIRST_NAME% - Thank you for your business!",
      "front_image_url": "https://d2md0c8rpvzmz5.cloudfront.net/inspiration_templates/default10.png"
    }'
    ```
