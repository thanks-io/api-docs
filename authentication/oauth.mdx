# introduction

Thanks.io supports OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and authorization. This allows users to grant your application access to their thanks.io account without sharing their credentials.

# Set Up

To integrate OAuth 2.0 with your application, follow these steps:

1.  **Create an account on thanks.io**: Create account [HERE](https://dashboard.thanks.io/register) if you haven't already.

2. **Register your OAuth Client**: Go to the [thanks.io API Settings](https://dashboard.thanks.io/developer) and register your application in the "OAuth Clients" section to obtain your client ID and client secret.  

# Implementation

1.  **Redirect user to authorize your application**: When a user wants to connect their thanks.io account to your application, redirect them to the thanks.io authorization endpoint with the following parameters:

```http
GET https://dashboard.thanks.io/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
```

2.  **Request your client's access token**: After the user authorizes your application, they will be redirected back to your specified redirect URI with an authorization code.  You'll use this AUTHORIZATION_CODE to request an access token:

```http
POST https://dashboard.thanks.io/oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
```

3.  **Store the tokens securely**: The response will include an access token, refresh token, and expiration time. Store these tokens securely.

4.  **Use the access token**: You can now use the access token to make authenticated requests to the thanks.io API as a [bearer token in the Authorization header](/authentication/bearer-token).

4. **Handle Token Expiration**: Access tokens have a limited lifespan. Implement token refresh logic to obtain new tokens using the refresh token flow.

```http
POST /oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&refresh_token=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN
```
