## Overview

Webhooks enable one service to automatically send real-time updates to another, eliminating the need for manual checks. Think of them as instant notifications - whenever a specific event occurs in the sending system, the receiving system is alerted immediately.

In the context of thanks.io, webhooks provide an efficient way to receive proactive alerts about various events, including USPS tracking updates and QR Code Scans.  Common webhook use cases include:

- Receiving notification when a recipient scans the QR Code on a mailer
- Getting notified when mailpieces fails to send
- Triggering workflows upon final delivery confirmation
